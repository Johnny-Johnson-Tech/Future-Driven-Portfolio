# Future-Driven-Portfolio

This is my learning portfolio for AI, Robotics, Space, and Engineering projects.  
I’m building skills in Python, C++, Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Robotics Simulation, and Computer Vision.

## Goals
- Learn AI & Robotics to prepare for Tesla AI or similar roles
- Develop transferable skills for space, engineering, and robotics careers
- Document all projects with code, explanations, and results

## Structure
- Python
- C++
- Machine-Learning
- Reinforcement-Learning
- Robotics-Simulation
- Computer-Vision

All projects will be added here as I learn new skills.
